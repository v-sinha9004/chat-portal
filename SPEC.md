# Project Assignment: Mentor–Mentee Chat Portal

## Objective

Build a web-based chat portal where:
- Mentors and mentees talk in program groups, AND
- Hold one-to-one conversations

inside the **UnsaidTalks** platform, with real-time messaging and role-based access.

---

## Problem Context

Mentors and mentees currently talk on WhatsApp groups. This causes:
- Personal phone numbers exposed to everyone in the group
- Announcements and doubts buried under casual messages
- No link between conversations and a program, batch or mentor on our platform
- No moderation, search or record of conversations
- Late joiners cannot see earlier discussions

**The goal:** Move these conversations to our web platform, with the ease of WhatsApp but built for mentorship.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Authentication & Roles
Support:
- Sign up and log in (email + password, JWT)
- Three roles: **Admin**, **Mentor**, **Mentee**
- Each role sees only its own groups and chats

### 2. Mentorship Groups (replaces WhatsApp groups)
- Admin creates a group per program or batch (e.g., *"TCS NQT Prep – Batch 12"*)
- Admin adds mentors and mentees to a group
- Chat list shows last message and unread count
- New members can read earlier messages

### 3. Real-Time Messaging (Mandatory Constraint)
- Use WebSockets (Socket.IO / Nest.js Gateway), not polling
- Messages appear instantly for all members, without refresh
- Each message shows:
  - Sender name and role badge (Mentor/Mentee)
  - Timestamp
- Messages stored in a database and reloaded after refresh
- Older messages load on scroll (pagination)
- Typing indicator and online/offline status

### 4. One-to-One Chat
- Mentee can start a private chat with a mentor of their group
- Mentor can message any mentee in their groups
- Mentee-to-mentee private chat is off by default

### 5. Mentor Tools (Key Requirement)
Make the chat work for mentorship, not just conversation:
- **Announcements**: mentor posts highlighted messages
- **Pin messages**: keep links and schedules at the top of a group
- **Doubts**: mentee marks a message as a doubt; mentor marks it resolved
- **Reply to message**: quote a specific message, like WhatsApp

### 6. File Sharing
- Share images and PDFs (max 5 MB)
- Inline preview for images; download link for PDFs

### 7. Notifications & Moderation
- Unread counts per chat
- In-app notification on replies and announcements
- Users delete their own messages; mentors/admins delete any message in their groups
- Report a message; reported messages appear on an admin screen
- No phone numbers or personal emails shown to other users

### 8. Architecture Expectations
Design for:
- Clear separation:
  - Auth and roles
  - Chat REST APIs (groups, history)
  - Real-time gateway (WebSockets)
  - Frontend UI
- Database schema for users, groups, members, and messages
- Seed script with sample users, groups, and messages
- Responsive UI (most students use phones)

---

## Bonus Considerations

- **WhatsApp import**: upload an exported chat (`.txt`) and convert it into a group's history
- **AI summary** of unresolved doubts for the mentor
- **Message search** within a group
- **Read receipts** and emoji reactions
- **Edit a message** within 5 minutes
- **Browser push notifications**
- **Deployed live link** (Vercel, Render, Railway)

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Reliability of real-time messaging**
- **Correct role-based access** (who can see and do what)
- **Mentorship features** (announcements, pins, doubts)
- **UX quality**, especially on mobile
- **Code structure and system scalability**
